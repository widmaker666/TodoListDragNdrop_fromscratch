# TodoListDragNdrop_fromscratch

This is a simple Todolist application built from scratch using HTML, SASS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to manage their tasks by dragging and dropping them into different columns representing today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. Users can also delete tasks by dragging them to a delete area. All tasks are saved in the local storage of the browser, and the application heavily relies on manipulating the DOM.

## Features

- Drag and drop tasks into different columns:
  - Today
  - Tomorrow
  - Day After Tomorrow
- Delete tasks by dragging them to a delete area.
- Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Usage

Local Storage
The Todolist application utilizes the browser's local storage to store tasks. This means that your tasks will be saved even if you close the browser or refresh the page.
